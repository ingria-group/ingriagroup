Furthermore, armed with experience as a company engaged in the construction sector, we started building the first housing in the Cimalaka area, Sumedang Regency in 2015. This housing development was based on the Company's desire to provide cheap housing but still prioritize quality, including the construction of carports, rows wider road."
